## Overview

This project is a versatile pet feeding device engineered with Arduino. The main goal is to create an efficient feeder capable of serving dogs of all sizes, from small to large breeds. The design takes into account the different dynamics and proportions of pet food for larger breeds, minimizing the risk of clogging that typically results from the larger food dimensions.

The feeder allows pet owners to program specific feeding schedules, determining both the timing and quantity of meals to be dispensed. The system offers the capacity to fine-tune the amount of food delivered, schedule feeding times, select an audible alert to indicate meal service, and adjust the volume of this alert. Moreover, it features a "treat" function, providing a small supplementary amount of food from its storage upon command.

The current version of DogFeederXL is just the beginning. Future plans include the development of an application to remotely manage and control the feeding system, offering enhanced flexibility and convenience.

The construction of the DogFeederXL involves the following components:

- Arduino Uno
- I2c rtc ds130
- Rotary encoder with switch
- Load cell
- DHT22
- Stepper motor nema 17 70:1
- Mp3 module with amplifier
- 16x4 LCD screen 
- DRV8825 Driver Module
- Uninterruptible mobile power supply
- Jack 5mm conection

Several components of the feeder, including its base, the screw, the bowl, the lid, and the reservoir, were 3D printed to achieve a precise and efficient design.
